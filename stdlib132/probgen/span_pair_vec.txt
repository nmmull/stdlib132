Determine a linear equation whose point set is the span of the following vectors.\footnote{{In this problem, we are conflating vectors and points.}}  The linear equation you determine should have relatively prime integer coefficients (i.e., it should not be possible to divide the equation by an integer value and get a new equation which integer coefficients).
