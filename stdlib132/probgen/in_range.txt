Determine if the vector $\mathbf v$ is in the range of the matrix transformation $T$ given by $\mathbf x \mapsto A \mathbf x$, where $A$ and $\mathbf v$ are defined below.
If $\mathbf v$ is in the range of $T$, then determine a vector whose image under $T$ is $\mathbf v$.
Furthermore, state whether the vector you determined is unique, i.e., determine if there is another vector whose image under $T$ is $\mathbf v$.
Explain your answer.
